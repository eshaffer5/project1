# For Project 1 our goal was to create a working calculator
# This code will do just that with the ability to add, subtract, multiply, divide, solve exponentials, and square roots as well
# The code is very straightforward with many descriptions that allow any user to easily understand what is going on
# The code works by using if/elif statements to figure out which operation the user would like to perform
# Once the operation is decided the code then works to solve any problem
